# advent-of-code

[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is my first year participating.
I'm not investing too much time in code quality, so expect some very ugly and janky stuff. I might revisit and refactor in the future.

Could still be useful or fun to check out my solutions.

## JavaScript

In order to run JavaScript solutions simply cd into the respective folder and run:

> node index.js
