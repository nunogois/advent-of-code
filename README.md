# advent-of-code

[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is my first year participating.
I'm not investing too much time in code quality, so expect some very ugly and janky stuff. I might revisit and refactor in the future.

Still, it could be useful or fun to check out my solutions.

## JavaScript

Why JavaScript? Because it's the language I default to when I want to do quick and hacky stuff like this without having to worry too much.
In order to run JavaScript solutions, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, clone this repo, then simply cd into the respective folder (e.g. `cd 2021/1`) and run:

> node index.js

Some of the solutions have examples based on the problem description to help me think about the problem. To run them: `node example.js`
